<h2>Seeking after</h2>
<p>Here you'll find all tools necessary to lazzily select particular properties in complex objects.</p>
<p>Think about css selectors, or jquery queries : you're asking particular DOM elements without nowing their exact place.</p>
<p>deepjs tries to offer same philosophy when you're working with your deeply structured objects. Simply ask, deepjs does the rest...</p>
<p>You could then design, manipulate or fire any parts of those complex structures without nowing exactly how they are shaped.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>You'll find tools as :</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="/queries/query">deep query</a> : another proposal for json/objects querying.</li>
        	<li><a href="/queries/rql">deep rql</a>  : deepjs oriented RQL js-array implementation.</li>
        	<li><a href="/queries/traversal">deep traversal</a>  : traversal functions (depth or breadth first) with test callback.</li>
        	<li><a href="/queries/selectors">deep selectors</a>  : small DSL that give test functions for traversal.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
        <p>All those tools work with particular <a href="/queries/descriptors">properties descriptors</a>, that handle all informations on matched nodes.</p>
