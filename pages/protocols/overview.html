  <h2>Service Locator</h2>
  <div class="dpdocs-baseline">aka protocols...</div>
</div>

			<p>A protocol is just simple, short, abstract, string reference that refer to a real (but not known in details) provider (that could provide any kind of responses or actions) placed in particular namespace (i.e. deep.protocols).</p>
			<p>You use it to hide/abstract real providers/services from your code.</p>
			<p>For convenience, simplicity, and json compliance, 'protocol' itself is placed, inline, in front of ressources (string) path (or parameters or wathever).</p>
			<p>Examples : </p>
			<ul>
				<li>"json::/my/json/path.json"</li>
				<li>"dom.htmlOf::#myDomID"</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>deepjs</strong> will retrieve those providers/services when needed, and acts therefor as an "abstract service locator". (google <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern">service locator</a>) </p>
			<p>It allow you to have <a href="#deep-protocol">fully "environnement dependent"</a> providers/services, and so allow you to go much further than with simple, classical Service Locator Pattern.</p>
			<p>Firstly, by  managing <a href="/ocm">OCManager</a> and secondly by playing with <a href="/context">deep.context</a> for you.</p>
			<p>You'll place there your Restful services, your ressources providers (Json, html,...) or more subtil and helpful providers that you'll learn to use.</p>
