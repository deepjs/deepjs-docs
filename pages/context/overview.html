		<p>Don't be fooled by the smallness of the navigation. This chapter is one of the most subtile and powerful and deserve big attention.</p>
		<p> It talks about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing">"concurrency programming"</a> and is primordial to safe, modular and lightweight concurrency design.</p>

		<p>For this, deepjs provides a single tools, called deep.context, that act as a contextualised "global" namespace (it looks like an oxymore).</p>

		<p>The pattern was taken from Kris Zyp promise implementation. Thx to him...;)</p>

		<p>This namespace is closely linked to promises, and could be seen as local promise's context.</p>
		<p>The magic is that you always access this local context globally...</p>
		<p>From anywhere just read deep.context (its an object) : it's your current <u>local</u> context. </p>
