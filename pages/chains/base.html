<p><em>"Servers can easily use vastly more asynchronous code-paths than a typical client-side application. Between database interactions, file I/O, HTTP requests, child processes [...], and more, server-side JavaScript can quickly become an overwhelming web of callbacks if not approached properly. Promises are a powerful tool in dealing with the complexity of composing various asynchronous actions and managing them in a coherent and encapsulated way, with reasonable flow and error handling. Most client-side modules only begin to venture into the full experience of the complex combinations of serial and parallel actions that can be commonplace on a NodeJS server, and can be smoothly handled by promises.[...]"</em></p>

        	<h3 id="explanation">Explanation by examples.</h3>
<p>As <strong>Promise</strong> could be challenging to understand without seeing it in action : let's do this directly.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<p>A promise is just a handler where you enqueue some functions that will be executed linearly (chained) : </p>
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var promise = new deep.Promise();

promise
.done(function(success){
	return success + " world";
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("error : ", error);
})
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success : ",success);
});
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you try this : nothing happens.</p>
<p>That's normal. The promise hasn't launched the execution of its queue. It waits for something to start.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">

<p>So let's take exactly the same example and add just a sentence : </p>
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var promise = new deep.Promise();

promise
.done(function(success){
	return success + " world";
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("error : ", error);
})
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("final success : ",success);
});

promise._start({ success:"hello" });
</pre>
</div>
<p>Blam... The queue has been executed !</p>


	</div>
</div>
<br/>
<p>So, what's happened ?</p>
<p>First, you could observe that both "done" has been fired. You could also observe that the value returned by the first done has been seen as success for second done. So callbacks are "wired".</p>
<p>Secondly : the "fail" callback hasn't been fired. It's because for the moment, the value passed through callbacks wasn't an error.</p>


<p>Let's try this :</p>
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var promise = new deep.Promise();

promise
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success 1 : ", success);
	return success + " world";
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("error : ", error);
})
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success 2 : ",success);
});

promise._start({ error:new Error("oups! error!") });
</pre>
</div>
<p>There, only the "fail" has been fired, because the value passed through callbacks was an error.</p>
<p>That's it... You've almost all the painting. A promise is just a queue, where you store callbacks, called linearly and selectively when a success or an error is injected.</p>
<p>Now, you need to know... that you will never, never, <u>never create a promise like above or use directly ._start(...)</u>. Never !</p>
<p>If you do so, either you're working on core tools, or you missed something. Forget it immediatly. It was just to show you the class itself (you'll never see it again...;)) and the delayed execution.</p>
                <div class="section-separator-small"></div>
<h3 id="deferred">deep.Deferred</h3>
<p>When you need a Promise, you could first use a Promise Distributor called "Deferred". Let's introducing it with asynchrone example :</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var def = deep.Deferred();
setTimeout(function(){
	def.resolve("hello from deferred");
}, 1000);

def.promise()
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success : ", success);
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("error : ", error);
});
</pre>
</div>



				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var def = deep.Deferred();
setTimeout(function(){
	def.reject(new Error("hello from deferred"));
}, 1000);

def.promise()
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success : ", success);
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("error : ", error);
});
</pre>
</div>


				</div>
			</div>
<p>Okay.. you got the point with deferred. A deferred is just a "promises distributor" that could be either resolved or rejected. When this arrive, it starts all previously distributed promises with its result as success or error. Nothing more.</p>


                <div class="section-separator-small"></div>
<h3 id="when">deep.when</h3>
<p>A second good way to obtain a Promise, is to use "when" function. This simple method takes something as argument and returns a promise :</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when("hello")
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success : ", success);
});
</pre>
</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when(new Error("oups!"))
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("error : ", error);
});
</pre>
</div>
				</div>
			</div>
<p>In both examples here, the "when" argument has been directly injected in the returned promise.</p>
<p>The interesting point here is that you could give a promise as "when" argument. (let's introduce a new method ".delay( ms )"" which delays the execution of callbacks after it.)</p>

<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var promise = deep.when("hello delayed world").delay(500);	// async simulation

deep.when(promise)
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("success : ", success);
});
</pre>
</div>
<p>There, the "when" function returns a second promise, that's waiting the resolution of the first one before executing its own queue.</p>
<p>The really interesting point here, is that "when" hides difference between sync and async programmation. Either you provide a "synced" value, and the returned promise is executed directly, either you provide a promise (synced or not) and the returned promise wait the first promise before start. In all cases, code still the same.</p>




                <div class="section-separator-small"></div>
<h3 id="all">deep.all(obj1, obj2, ...)</h3>
<p>How mentioning "deep.when( obj )" without mentioning its big brother : deep.all(obj1, obj2, ...).</p>

<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
var prom1 = deep.when("first").delay(100);
var prom2 = deep.when("second").delay(200);

deep.all(prom1, prom2, "third")
.done(function(success){
	deep.log(success);
})
</pre>
</div>
<p>It returns you a single promise that waits for the resolution of all arguments passed. The success injected in returned promise is the array of resolved values. And as you could see, "immediate" values are also managed.</p>

                <div class="section-separator-small"></div>
        	<h3 id="three-famillies">3 famillies and big APIs</h3>

<p>Fondamentaly, there is three kinds of callback famillies. You already know the two first ones : "done" and "fail". Stills a third one : "always".</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt><a href="/chains/promise#done">done</a></dt><dd>Runs only if current value(s) holded by the promise is not an Error.</dd>
	<dt><a href="/chains/promise#fail">fail</a></dt><dd>Runs only if current value(s) holded by the promise is an Error.</dd>
	<dt><a href="/chains/promise#always">always</a></dt><dd>Always runs : the value(s) holded could be anything.</dd>
</dl>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when("hello promise")
.always(function(s, e){
	deep.log("always : s: ", s, " - e : ", e);
})
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("done : ", success);
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("fail : ", error);
});
</pre>
</div>
   
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when(new Error("bye bye!"))
.always(function(s, e){
	deep.log("always : s: ", s, " - e : ", e);
})
.done(function(success){
	deep.log("done : ", success);
})
.fail(function(error){
	deep.log("fail : ", error);
});
</pre>
</div>
   
				</div>
			</div>


<p>Why is this so important to know now ? Simply because the Promise API has been decorated with lot of methods, and Promise based chains also add their own methods. And the fact is that all methods from deepjs chains (Promise or others) belong to one of those famillies.</p>
<p>To explain that, let's introduce 3 logging methods :  .log(), .slog(), .elog()</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt><a href="/chains/promise#done">.log()</a></dt><dd>Always familly : will log current chain's success OR error.</dd>
	<dt><a href="/chains/promise#fail">.slog()</a></dt><dd>Done familly : will only log current success (if any).</dd>
	<dt><a href="/chains/promise#always">.elog()</a></dt><dd>Fail familly : will only log current error (if any).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's take previous example and rewrite it with those new methods :</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when("hello promise")
.log("always : ")
.slog("done : ")
.elog("fail : ");
</pre>
</div>
   
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
<div class="dp-example">
<pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when(new Error("bye bye!"))
.log("always : ")
.slog("done : ")
.elog("fail : ");
</pre>
</div>
   
				</div>
			</div>


                <div class="section-separator-small"></div>
<h3 id="return-rules">The "return" rules</h3>

<p>if returned value is :</p>

<ul>
<li>undefined : take previous success or error (so it does not modify current promise state)</li>
<li>an error : inject error as failure in chain (so change state to 'error')</li>
<li>a promise : wait promise resolution to either inject its success or its error in current chain.</li>
<li>a deep.Undefined : it will force 'undefined' injection in chain.</li>
<li>any other type : inject it as success in chain (so if the promise was in 'error' state : it's now in 'success' state)</li>
</ul>
<p>if an error is thrown : from within any handle : it depends if chain catch errors (by default, it catch them).
</p>
<p><span class="label label-info">Remarque</span> that's true for both done and fail families. </p>
<p>That implied that you could always catch and handles errors produced within any callbacks with a .fail(callback) placed after in chain (that will be fired as promise state is error), and then return (in the fail callback) something that's not an Error, and so reset current promise state to success.</p>

            <div class="dp-example">
                <pre dp-try class="dp-box code">
deep.when(new Error("hello error"))
.done(function(success){
    // this callback will simply be ignored, as promise state is 'error'.
    // ...
})
.fail(function(e){
    // this one will be fired as promise state is 'error'
    // but as it return nothing (so undefined), it does not modifiy promise state.
    deep.log("error : ", e.toString());
})
.fail(function(e){    // also fired as promise state stills 'error'.
    return "error handled : continue chain";
})
.done(function(success){    // this one will be fired, as state has been reseted to 'success'
    deep.log("success : ", success);
});
</pre></div>
