			<h2>Chained time management</h2>
			<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
			<p>deepjs use and abuse of Chaning Pattern. First for time management - as all deepjs chained and asynchrone management is based on <a href="/chains/promise">Promises</a> - but also for syntax ergonomy.</p>
			<p>For clarity and modularity, deepjs comes with a set of particular chains API, dedicated to specific tasks.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li><a href="/chains/promise">promise</a></li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/deep">deep</a></li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/rest">rest</a></li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others#fs">fs</a></li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others#sh">sh</a></li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others#ssh">ssh</a></li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others">...</a></li>
              </ul>
             <p>Each specific chain is based on Promise one and so could be seen as a "super-promise" with an extended API.</p>
             <p>But remember that they are all based on same mecanism and behaviours.</p>
		
			<h3 id="identities">Identities</h3>

			<p>When you manipulate such chain, you could always change the chain identity (so its API) by calling identities method. Each chain come with it's own identity method.</p>

<pre class="dp-box code">
deep.fs("/my/root")				// we start a "file system" chain (nodejs) 
.from("myjsonfile.json")		// read a json file
.done(function(success){		// manipulate loaded json
	succes.myProp = "hello world";
	//...
})
.rest("myService")		// we take the "restful chain" API
.post()					// post current success (so maniplated loaded json) to myService
.fail(function(error){
	// handle any error produced somewhere in the chain
});
</pre>





			states, context

	     	<p>Mediator	 Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.</p>	
	
	       	<p>Memento	 Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.</p>

	       	<p>State	 Alter an object's behavior when its state changes</p>
