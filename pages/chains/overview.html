  <h2>Chained time management</h2>
  <div class="dpdocs-baseline">At the beginning was the Promise...</div>
</div>

			
			<p><strong>deepjs</strong> use and abuse of Chaning Pattern. Before all for time management - as all deepjs chained and asynchrone management is based on <a href="/chains/promise">Promises</a> - but also for syntax ergonomy.</p>

			<h3 id="chains">and then the Chains appear.</h3>
			<p>deepjs comes with a set of particular chains API dedicated to specific tasks.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li><a href="/chains/deep">deep</a> : collects all the deepjs specific API (layers &amp; queries).</li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/rest">restful</a> : act as mediator for restful stores.</li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others#fs">fs</a> : manage async fs calls (nodejs).</li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others#sh">sh</a> : manage shell sessions and commands.</li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others#ssh">ssh</a> : manage SSH sessions and commands.</li>
              	<li><a href="/chains/others">...</a></li>
              </ul>
             <p>Each specific chain is based on Promise and so could be seen as a "super-promise" with an extended API.</p>
             <p>But remember that they are all based on same mecanism and behaviours.</p>
		
			<h3 id="identities">Identities</h3>

			<p>When you manipulate such chain (including Promise), you could always change the chain's identity (so its API) by calling identities method. Each chain come with it's own identity method.</p>

<pre class="dp-box code">
deep.fs("/my/root")				// we start a "file system" chain (nodejs) 
.from("myjsonfile.json")		// read a json file
.done(function(success){		// manipulate loaded json
	succes.myProp = "hello world";
	//...
})
.rest("myService")		// we take the "restful chain" API
.post()					// post current success (so maniplated loaded json) to myService
.fail(function(error){
	// handle any error produced somewhere in the chain
});
</pre>





			states, context

	     	<p>Mediator	 Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.</p>	
	
	       	<p>Memento	 Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.</p>

	       	<p>State	 Alter an object's behavior when its state changes</p>
