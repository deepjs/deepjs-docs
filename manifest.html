				<h3><span class="bullet-title">&gt;</span> The core.</h3>
<p>The deepjs idea is to propose new generic ways of thinking and running javascript code.</p>

<p>In 2 words, it could be defined as <strong>"space-time programming"</strong>.</p>

<h4>Space</h4> 
 (i.e. taking care of the structure of - nested - objects that shape your app)
<p><ul>
 <li><strong>to design objects like "layers"</strong> : <br><br>
 Any js object (structured and deep as you want) is seen like what we called a "layer". You can merge layers to create more complexe objects helped by tools that manage possible collisions on datas (merging rules) or functions (composition rules).
 <br>This vision of objects as layers tend to create more modular/reusable/maintainable objects or applications.
 <br><br>
  - we could apply layers on any objects by the bottom (like a background) : use it for classic OOP (inheritance, compostion).<br><br> 
- And we could apply layers by the up (like a foreground) : use it to add aspects on your objects to specialise, add capabilities, modify or whatever.<br><br>
Those easy manipulation of layers are also really great about metadata management (think about JSON) ! 

 
<br><br>

 i.e. to design freely whatever object (OO meaning), as structured (functions, datas, ...) and deep as you want, by merging complex objects (seen as layers) together (kind of Aspect Oriented Programmation with deepness management) </li>

<li><strong>to manipulate those "layers" with query</strong> : <br><br>
We could query existant object structures before applying them some aspects at precise(s) place(s) depending on a more or less complex filter.
<br><br>
- It helps you modelise without knowing the complete structure of your objects/applications. Which gives by example some great tools as "code sheets" that could be compared with "styles sheets".
<br><br> 
- And it helps to select objects you want to manipulate in run-time ( could be compared to JQuery but with your code and not the DOM), that help about losing coupling.</li>

<li><strong>to use specific inheritance tools</strong> as "local internal inheritance" (an object could inherit locally from a brother, a oncle, or a mix of them, etc.) or by describing, at any structure deepness what are the objects/aspects "backgrounds".</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Time</h4>
<p>(i.e. taking care of the (async) time management between function's calls)</p>

<p>The core handle async promises "auto-magically" for you at almost any level... </p>

<p><ul>
<li>It use and abuse of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">Promise Pipelining</a> pattern (async programmation with "promises") and provides a set of 'async chains' (objects with specific chainable API to manage File System, a shell session (or ssh), a db transaction, a call to a services, etc. or simply datas transformations...<br/>
Thanks to Promises : it hide differences between sync and async programmation.</li>

<li>When merging two objects, deepjs also manages time sequence between merged functions/methods. It mimics the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">Promise Pipelining</a> pattern and make function's composition a pleasure (sync or not) and provides nice way of errors handling.</li>

<li>In addition, we could play with local concurrent contexts (particular namespace) that are associated to each asynch call and define their own context.<br/>
Thanks to this pattern (that come from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">Futures</a> and <a href="https://github.com/persvr">Kris Zyp</a> work) : it really makes concurrent programmation easier.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Object Capability Model</h4>
<p>All this together (<strong>layer tools + query + inheritances + asynch/promises + concurrent context</strong>) plus another set of tools to manage "<strong>dependance injections</strong>" allow us to provide one of the most practical implementations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">OCM</a> (Object Capability Model) paradigm for javascript, which become suddenly really usable and elegant.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">OCM</a></strong> should be seen here as the capacity to produce dynamically objects (OO meaning - or even simple primitive value) with a structure that depends on environnement flags - user role(s), production/dev flags, particular modes, etc. - and as said before, the environnement itself could be concurrently managed.</p>

<h4>All together</h4>
<p>All those tools give <strong>"space-time programmation"</strong> paradigm (OCM is a part of it, and classical OO is a particular case of it), and has really positive and deep implications in security or achitecture of code.</p>

<p>A poetic image could be :</p>
<div class="dp-box code">The code is seen as landscape, with valleys and mountains (aka. stacks of 'aspects'), that we flatten in a big unique structure, which began to vibrate locally following async runs, with the possibility to create on the fly, at any point of this space, some parallels worlds depending on local environnement.</div>

<p>Voil√†, this is what deepjs core talking about.</p>

<h3><span class="bullet-title">&gt;</span> The framework.</h3>

Then, based on those tools, that are really generic, we've develop a framework that answer originaly to different problems that come with modern web app software engineering : <strong>management of routes and views, HTTP/Rest services design, homogeneous NoSQL ressources, browser/serveur isomorphism, ...</strong>.
